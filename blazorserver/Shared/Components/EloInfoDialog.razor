            This rankings page uses the Elo system to rate teams. This is a simple rating system used to rank head-to-head sports
            event and games like chess.
            <br/>
            In essence, Elo assigns every team a rating based on their previous results. When two teams are matched up, the win
            probability for each team is calculated and the winning team is awarded a number of points relative to their expected
            win probability. The losing team's rating is reduced by the same amount.
            <br/>
            This means that upsets award many points and teams that win when they are expected to only receive a small bump in
            rating.
            <br/>
            The calculations also take the magin of victory into account so the more goals a team wins by will result in
            a larger increase in ratings. Likewise for rating decrease from losing by a large margin.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            As there were a large amount of walk over games during the 2019-2020 season due to COVID-19, this might misrepresent
            teams true strength. Therefore rankings will start from the 2021-2022 season.
            Ratings tend to converge on a team's true strength relative to its competitors after about 30 matches.
            Ratings for teams with fewer than 30 matches should be considered provisional.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It is slightly unusual to use Elo ratings in a sports environment with leagues, promotion, and relegation however
            this can be taken into acount by staggering the starting Elo ratings for teams relative to the strength of the league
            each team plays in. For example, the men's premiership league teams will start on a rating of 2000 and teams in
            men's regional 2 may only start on 1500.
